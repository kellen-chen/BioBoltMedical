            <h2>About BioBolt</h2>
            <p>Up to 30% of abdominal surgeries are complicated by incisional or ventral hernia. These hernias can grow in size over time, cause strangulation of the colon, have considerable pain, and be cosmetically unappealing. Hernias often require surgery to fix, with the insertion of mesh support. Biosynthetic and other solid meshes are becoming increasingly popular for hernia mesh repair and have been found to be better for patient outcomes. However, current surgical staplers cannot affix solid biological meshes, forcing surgeons to tediously suture the meshes.</p>

            <h2>Our Technology</h2>
            <img src="images/BioBolt_Image_1.png" alt="BioBolt Technology" class="tech-image">
            <p>BioBolt Medical has recently developed an innovative technology and design that allows surgeons to perform procedures with greater speed, efficiency, and precision. We have developed the BioBolt Surgical Stapler that can pierce, manipulate, and fix a variety of meshes and tissues with the speed of a stapler and the strength of a suture. This device is specifically designed for hernia repair, allowing surgeons to attach all meshes, including solid meshes, to human tissue with minimal time, reducing a 30-60 minutes suturing process to just 5 minutes. Our extensive testing has shown that tissue pull out strength with BioBolt is not only equivalent in strength with suturing, but also better in consistency. Furthermore, this technology eliminates the need for sharp or metal fixation devices with closed staple loops, minimizing the risks of tissue damage, ischemia, and adhesions. The simple and easy-to-use design of the BioBolt device promises to enhance patient surgical outcomes, enable robotic procedures, and eliminate knot tying, thus reducing the risk of mesh tears.</p>
            <p>Not only is the BioBolt stapler expected to bring significant cost savings to the healthcare system and patients, but it also has the potential to improve patient outcomes. By reducing surgery and anesthesia time, patients are exposed to fewer risks and complications, which can lead to quicker recovery times. Furthermore, the BioBolt stapler offers a minimally invasive alternative to traditional suturing and stitching techniques, which can result in less scarring, pain and bleeding, as well as a more comfortable recovery experience. As such, the BioBolt stapler is not only a cost-efficient solution, but also a patient-centric one, which will have a positive impact on the overall healthcare experience.</p>
